\title{Create a \linkS4class{fhir_design} object}
\usage{
fhir_design(..., names)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One ore more \linkS4class{fhir_df_description} objects or a named list containing
\linkS4class{fhir_df_description} objects, see examples.}

\item{names}{The names of the df_descriptions. This argument is not necessary when df_descriptions are
provided in a named list and will be ignored in this case.
The names will also be the names of the resulting data.frames in \code{\link[=fhir_crack]{fhir_crack()}}.}
}
\description{
A \linkS4class{fhir_design} is a list of \linkS4class{fhir_df_description} objects and should be created
using the function described here. For backwards compatibility
it is for the moment also possible to build it from an old-style design as used in
\verb{fhircrackr (< 1.0.0)}. See examples.

###Example 1 ####

#create fhir_df_descriptions

df_desc1 <- fhir_df_description(resource = "Patient",
                    cols = c(name = "name/family",

#create design

#First option
design <- fhir_design(df_desc1, df_desc2, names = c("Patients", "Observations"))

#second option
design <- fhir_design(list(Patients = df_desc1, Observations = df_desc2))

#have a look at the design
design

###Example 2###
#This option will be deprecated at some point
