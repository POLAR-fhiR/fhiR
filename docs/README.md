This branch implements some first attempts at transforming a cracked data.frame back into the original FHIR resources. It is based on an outdated version of the fhircrackr (0.2.1), is not worked on at the moment and will probably be deleted at some point. The functions to create resources seem to work in most cases but there is no guarantuee they will create correct resources all the time. Do not use them for any sensitive work! The general idea of recreating FHIR resources will be resumed at a later point in the main branch of the package.
